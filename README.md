# Vulnerability Management System
 Create a system that scans networks for vulnerabilities, aggregates scan results, and generates reports. The system should support importing scan data from various vulnerability scanners and output results in a standardized JSON format.

 # Scanner Integration
    Objective: Integrate with popular vulnerability scanners (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS) to import scan results.

    Steps:

    Research Scanner APIs: Study the APIs of the chosen vulnerability scanners. For example, Nessus provides a REST API, and OpenVAS uses an XML-based protocol called OSP (Open Scanner Protocol).
    Authentication: Set up authentication mechanisms to securely connect to the scanners' APIs.
    Data Extraction: Write scripts or services to fetch scan results. Use API endpoints to request scan data and handle responses.
